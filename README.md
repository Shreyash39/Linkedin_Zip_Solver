🚀 Zip Puzzle Solver: Unraveling the Grid! 🧩Welcome to the Zip Puzzle Solver repository! This project dives deep into the fascinating world of algorithmic puzzles, offering a robust C++ solution for a unique grid-based challenge. Prepare to explore paths, navigate tricky walls, and conquer numerical sequences in a quest to zip through every corner of the puzzle!What's the "Zip Puzzle"? A Challenge Unveiled!Imagine a mysterious grid, each cell holding a secret. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a single, continuous path that visits every single non-blocked cell, starting from a designated '1', following a strict numerical order, and skillfully avoiding hidden walls. It's a blend of logic, spatial reasoning, and a touch of number magic!The Grid's Secrets: Your InputsTo crack the Zip Puzzle, you'll provide three crucial pieces of intelligence, each represented by a matrix:The Map Matrix (the_map): The heart of the puzzle, an m x n grid revealing the soul of each cell:1: Your starting line! This is where your thrilling journey begins.-1: Blocked! These cells are forbidden zones; no entry allowed.Positive Integers (>1): These are your milestones! You must visit these numbers in strictly non-decreasing order. The highest number in the grid (excluding -1) is your final destination, the grand finale of your path.Horizontal Walls Matrix (h_walls): This m x n matrix is your architectural blueprint for horizontal barriers.0: Clear Path! Feel free to move right from cell (i, j) to (i, j+1).1: Impenetrable Wall! A horizontal barrier stands firm, blocking any rightward movement from (i, j) to (i, j+1).Vertical Walls Matrix (v_walls): Similarly, this m x n matrix unveils the vertical obstacles.0: Open Passage! You're free to move down from cell (i, j) to (i+1, j).1: Solid Barrier! A vertical wall blocks any downward movement from (i, j) to (i+1, j).Your Mission Briefing: The Movement RulesEvery great adventure has its rules. Master these, and victory shall be yours:Four Directions of Freedom: You can move horizontally (left/right) or vertically (up/down) to any immediately adjacent cell.No Redundant Steps: Once a cell is part of your path, it cannot be re-visited.Respect the Blockades: Cells marked -1 are off-limits, forever unvisited.Mind the Walls: Those h_walls and v_walls aren't just for show – they truly block your way!The Numerical Ascent: If you land on a cell with a positive number X, your next positive numbered cell must have a value Y such that Y≥X. No backtracking on the number line!No U-Turns!: You can't immediately reverse course and move back to the cell you just departed from (if it's the second-to-last cell in your path).The Grand Tour: The ultimate goal: your path must touch every single non-blocked cell in the grid. Leave no traversable cell behind!The Final Countdown: Your journey culminates precisely at the cell containing the highest positive number in the map matrix.The Algorithmic Engine: How We Solve ItThis puzzle is a classic candidate for backtracking, a powerful algorithmic technique. Our solution employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) strategy, systematically exploring every potential path, one step at a time, until the perfect solution emerges (or we confirm none exists!).Inside the Solver: Key ComponentsisValidMove(current_row, current_col, next_row, next_col, ...): This guardian function meticulously checks if a prospective move is legitimate. It verifies boundaries, checks if the cell is already visited, prevents immediate reversals, upholds the numerical sequence rule, and, of course, ensures you don't crash into a wall!checkAllVisited(const vector<vector<bool>>& vis): A quick inspection tool to confirm if every non-blocked cell has been successfully included in our path. This is a crucial check when we hit our target number.solve(map_numbers, horizontal_walls, vertical_walls, current_path, visited_yet, current_row, current_col, last_num_seen, target_number): The heart of our recursive journey. This function navigates the grid, making moves, marking cells, and, if a dead end is hit, elegantly backtracks to explore alternative routes. It's a tireless explorer, constantly pushing forward until the entire puzzle is mapped out or deemed unsolvable.printMatrix(const vector<vector<int>>& the_map, const vector<vector<int>>& path_coords, int m, int n): Once a solution is found, this function brings it to life! It visually renders your triumphant path on the grid, using the original numbers for milestones and intuitive directional arrows (<, >, \text{^}, v) to show the flow. The final destination is proudly marked with an 'X'!Ready to Play? Input & OutputProviding Your Puzzle: Input FormatFeed your puzzle data into standard input (cin) in this precise order:m n: The grid's dimensions (m rows, n columns).Followed by m lines, each with n integers: Your the_map matrix.Then, m lines, each with n integers: The h_walls matrix.Finally, m lines, each with n integers: The v_walls matrix.# Example Input: A 3x3 grid with a path from 1 to 2, bypassing a blocked cell

Witnessing the Solution: Output FormatPath Found! If our solver successfully navigates the maze and finds a valid path, it will proudly display the grid with your journey visualized using numbers and elegant directional arrows. The grand finale cell will be marked with a bold 'X'.# Example Output for the above input:
1 > v
^ -1 v
^ < X
No Path Found! Should the puzzle prove insurmountable under the given rules, a clear message will confirm: No way to visit all cells with these rules. No path found!Getting Started: Compile & Run!Embark on your puzzle-solving adventure! You'll need a C++ compiler (like g++) to bring this code to life.# Compile the C++ source code
g++ Main.cpp -o zip_puzzle_solver

# Run the solver, feeding it your puzzle input from a file (e.g., input.txt)
./zip_puzzle_solver < input.txt
(Alternatively, you can type the input directly into your console after running ./zip_puzzle_solver)The Road Ahead: Future Enhancements (Ideas for Your Next Challenge!)This project is a solid foundation, but the journey of innovation never truly ends!
